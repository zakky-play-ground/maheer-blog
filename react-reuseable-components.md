Bilkul, main aapko har point ke sath hints ke sath describe karunga:

**1. Component Structure:**
   - Reusable components should have their own file, typically in the "components" directory.
   - Create a new `.js` or `.jsx` file for each component.

**2. Component Props:**
   - Reusable components can accept data through "props."
   - When defining your component function, include a parameter for "props."

**3. Reusable Button Component:**
   - Create a reusable button component to use throughout your app.
   - The button component should accept props like "text" and "onClick."

**Hint: Reusable Button Component**
   - Define a function in a separate file (e.g., `Button.js`).
   - This function should take "props" as an argument and return a button element.
   - You can customize the button's text and its click event by using "props."

**4. Using the Reusable Button:**
   - Import the reusable button component in the file where you want to use it.
   - Pass the necessary props to the button component.

**Hint: Using the Reusable Button**
   - Import the button component at the top of your file.
   - You can pass the text and an event handler function as props when rendering the button.

**5. Component Composition:**
   - To create complex UIs, combine multiple components within each other.
   - Reuse these components across different parts of your application.

**6. Component Props Validation:**
   - It's a good practice to validate the types of props using PropTypes or TypeScript.
   - This ensures that the right types of data are passed to the component.

**Hint: PropTypes for Button Component**
   - Use PropTypes to specify the expected prop types.
   - In the case of the button component, you might expect "text" as a string and "onClick" as a function.

**7. Styling Reusable Components:**
   - Style your components with CSS.
   - You can use CSS modules or styled-components for modular styling.

**8. Documentation:**
   - Write documentation for your components.
   - Include usage examples to help other developers understand how to use them.

These hints should guide you in creating reusable components in React and Next.js. Each hint focuses on a specific aspect of component development, from structuring your components to validating props and styling them.
