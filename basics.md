| Concept | Usage | Example | Analogy |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| Variables | Store data | `int x = 5;` | Our brain stores information. |
| Functions | Perform specific tasks | `void printHello() { cout << "Hello"; }` | Our muscles perform specific tasks. |
| Loops | Repeat a block of code | `for(int i=0; i<5; i++) { cout << i; }` | Our heart pumps blood continuously. |
| Conditionals | Execute code based on certain conditions | `if(x > 5) { cout << "Greater than 5"; }` | Our mind makes decisions based on conditions. |
| Arrays | Store multiple values in a single variable | `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};` | Our memory stores multiple pieces of information. |
| Objects | Represent entities in the real world | `class Car { string color; int speed; };` | Our bodies are made up of various parts. |
| Classes | Define the structure of objects | `class Car { string color; int speed; void honk() { cout << "Beep!"; } };` | Our brains define our thoughts and actions. |
