[React Components] -> [React-three-fiber Renderer] -> [three.js Scene]

renderer= covert long code into short code


Sure, let's break down the sentence into a list with simple explanations:

1. **Build your scene declaratively:**
   - **Build your scene clearly and explicitly:**
     - Create your 3D environment step by step in a straightforward manner.

2. **with re-usable, self-contained components:**
   - **using components that you can use again and are self-contained:**
     - Make parts of your scene that you can easily reuse and manage independently.

3. **that react to state:**
   - **that change based on their condition:**
     - Components can dynamically adjust or change based on their current state.

4. **are readily interactive:**
   - **can be easily interacted with:**
     - Components are designed to respond to user interactions seamlessly.

5. **and can participate in React's ecosystem:**
   - **and can work well with other React features:**
     - Your 3D components fit smoothly into the larger React framework, leveraging its capabilities.

Does it have limitations?
None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.

Is it slower than plain Threejs?
No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.



Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?
Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, <mesh /> dynamically turns into new THREE.Mesh(). If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library



Sure, let's break down each line with simple explanations:

```jsx
// Create a reusable component
const MyComponent = () => {
```

- **Create a reusable component:**
  - **Make something you can use again.**

```jsx
// Keep track of its own state
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- **Keep track of its own state:**
  - **Remember its own condition using `useState`.**

```jsx
// React to user-input
  const handleUserInput = (event) => {
    // Do something with the user's input
  };
```

- **React to user-input:**
  - **Respond when the user interacts.**

```jsx
// Participate in the render-loop
  useFrame(() => {
    // Do something in every frame of the render-loop
  });

  return (
    // JSX describing how the component should look
    <mesh>
      {/* Additional JSX for the component */}
    </mesh>
  );
};
```

- **Participate in the render-loop:**
  - **Play a role in continuously displaying things on the screen.**

- **JSX describing how the component should look:**
  - **Use JSX to say what the component should be like.**
